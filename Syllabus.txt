Reviews
Yes, it was. For me, it's a whole package for diving into the exciting journey of full- stack web development.
Great course, If the video is to fast you can slow it down and if the chapter is outdated you can google it and figure it out, that' s part of the learning process.	
Angela is an amazing teacher म ... I totally recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn webdev.
Every concept is explained very nicely and the teaching approach is what makes this course super amazing as it gives problem statement to solve every single concept. So far loving the tutorial.
